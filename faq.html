                        <p><strong>Important Disclosure:</strong> Universal Space Consultant is an independent third-party service assistance startup, founded in 2026, and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any cable, internet, or streaming service provider. We provide guidance and support services only; we do not sell internet, cable, or streaming plans.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <h2>About Our Service Model</h2>

                <h3>Is Universal Space Consultant a cable or internet service provider?</h3>
                <p>No. Universal Space Consultant is an independent third-party service assistance startup. We do not sell internet, cable, or streaming services. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any service provider. Instead, we provide guidance, support, and coordination services to help you manage your accounts with actual providers like AT&T®, Verizon®, Spectrum®, and others.</p>

                <h3>Do you sell internet, cable, or streaming plans?</h3>
                <p>No. Universal Space Consultant does not sell service plans. We provide educational guidance and support services only. We help you research providers, understand your options, and guide you through the signup and management process. The actual services are delivered by third-party providers, and billing comes directly from them.</p>

                <h3>What exactly does Universal Space Consultant do?</h3>
                <p>We provide expert guidance and coordination services including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helping you understand available service options from various providers</li>
                    <li>Assisting with account setup and activation coordination</li>
                    <li>Acting as a liaison for technical support coordination</li>
                    <li>Reviewing and explaining your bills</li>
                    <li>Facilitating plan modifications or account closures</li>
                    <li>Ongoing account management support</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>About Our Fees</h2>

                <h3>What do you charge for your services?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Universal Space Consultant charges separate service assistance fees for our guidance, coordination, and support services. These fees are detailed on our website and include options like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial Consultation & Guidance: $29.99–$49.99</li>
                    <li>Setup Coordination: $49.99–$79.99</li>
                    <li>Ongoing Monthly Support: $19.99/month</li>
                    <li>Modifications or Cancellation: $39.99–$69.99</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These fees are in addition to any charges from your service provider.</p>

                <h3>Will my provider still bill me separately?</h3>
                <p>Yes, absolutely. Your service provider will continue to bill you separately for your actual service charges (internet, cable, streaming). Universal Space Consultant's assistance fees are completely independent. You will receive two separate bills: one from your provider for services and one from Universal Space Consultant for our guidance and coordination support.</p>

                <h3>Are your fees guaranteed upfront?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Before we commit to any service, we provide transparent pricing for the specific service option you need. All fees are disclosed upfront so there are no surprises.</p>

                <h3>Why do I have to pay Universal Space Consultant when my provider already charges me?</h3>
                <p>Universal Space Consultant's fees compensate us for the expert guidance, coordination, and support we provide. We handle tasks like guiding you through provider options, coordinating setup, resolving technical issues with your provider, reviewing bills for optimization, and managing account changes. These services save you time and help ensure you're getting the best value. Your provider's charges cover the actual internet, cable, or streaming service delivery.</p>

                <h2>About Billing & Privacy</h2>

                <h3>Do you need my account passwords?</h3>
                <p>No. We never request your provider account passwords or sensitive credentials. We never access your provider account directly. When we coordinate with providers on your behalf, we do so with your explicit authorization and through proper channels. Your account security is our priority.</p>

                <h3>Will you sell my information to providers or others?</h3>
                <p>No. We do not share your personal information with service providers without your explicit consent. We never sell your data to third parties. Your information is protected under our Privacy Policy and handled with strict confidentiality.</p>

                <h3>How is my data protected?</h3>
                <p>We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your personal and financial information. All sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and storage. Only authorized team members with specific roles have access to your information, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements. For complete details, please review our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h2>About Service Providers</h2>

                <h3>Which providers can you help me with?</h3>
                <p>Universal Space Consultant can assist with guidance for many providers, including AT&T®, Verizon®, Spectrum®, Xfinity®, Frontier®, T-Mobile®, and others. We reference these providers for educational guidance only. We maintain no exclusive affiliation with any provider. Contact us to confirm whether we can assist with your specific provider.</p>

                <h3>Are you affiliated with any service providers?</h3>
                <p>No. Universal Space Consultant is an independent startup with no affiliation, partnership, or endorsement relationship with any service provider. We are not authorized dealers or official representatives of any provider. We are a third-party guidance and support platform.</p>

                <h3>What happens if I have issues with my provider's service?</h3>
                <p>Universal Space Consultant's role is to coordinate and facilitate support on your behalf. If you experience service quality issues with your provider, we help liaison between you and the provider's technical support team. However, the service provider remains responsible for service quality, uptime, and reliability. We facilitate troubleshooting, but the provider delivers the actual service.</p>

                <h2>About Refunds</h2>

                <h3>Are your services refundable?</h3>

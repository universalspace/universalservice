                <h3>Refunds Cannot Be Guaranteed</h3>
                <p>While we strive to resolve customer concerns, refund eligibility depends on specific circumstances. Not all refund requests will be approved. Each request is evaluated individually based on the extent of work completed and services rendered.</p>

                <h3>Service Provider Refunds</h3>
                <p>Universal Space Consultant refunds cover only our service assistance fees. We cannot refund charges billed by service providers (internet, cable, streaming, etc.).

                <p>Refund requests submitted after the applicable service-specific refund window (7–15 days) will not be considered. Please submit requests as soon as possible to ensure eligibility.</p>

                <h3>Work Completion Assessment</h3>
                <p>Refund eligibility is determined based on the amount of work completed. If substantial coordination, research, or support services have been provided, refunds may be denied even if within the refund window.</p>
